# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Title

Handle errors and exceptions

## Status

[Accepted]

## Context

How to handle errors and exceptions in applications?

## Decision

We've decided to handle all exceptions, i.e. all errors that originate from the application, i.e. that belong to the business, with the application and without throwing an exception or using try/catch.

Exceptions and the use of try/catch are very demanding for the application. Furthermore, it is not possible to achieve strong typing with the use of try/catch.

Furthermore, all non-application errors will be handled by exceptions and the use of throw/try/catch.

## Alternatives Considered

None.

## Consequences

To do this, we've set up a Result type that can return either a success or a failure.

We need to handle both successes and failures within the application itself, without throwing an exception.

We are setting up an interceptor to recover failures and return them to the client with the correct code status.

We also create an exception filter to catch any non-application errors or exceptions that have been thrown.
