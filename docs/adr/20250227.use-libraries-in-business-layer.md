# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Title

Use of libraries in the business layer

## Status

[Accepted]

## Context

Which libraries are authorized in the business layer?

As a general rule, the business layer should not include any external libraries.

However, when using the NestJs framework, it is important to reflect on the use of certain NestJs principles within the business layer.

For example, it's quite easy to extend an entity using NestJs' AggregateRoot class, in order to benefit from the AggregateRoot class's functionalities in the application layer.

Similarly, when it comes to logging information, it's easier to use the NestJs logger than to create a separate one.

## Decision

We have therefore authorized the use of the AggregateRoot class and the Logger class in the business layer, and only these two classes.

We remind you that the business layer must remain as independent as possible from external technologies, and that it is supposed to function without external libraries.

## Alternatives Considered

None.

## Consequences

the AggregateRoot class and the Logger class in the business layer.

## References

Any.
